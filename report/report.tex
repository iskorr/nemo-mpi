\begin{abstract}

Motivation behind the development of spiking neural networks arised from the growing interest in the area of neural 
computation and studies of brain activity in the recent years. The reason lies in the fact that SNNs incorporate time
into neuron firing computation and signify the role of interconnectedness between neurons, therefore bringing the simulation 
level closer to reality.

However, as a result of such improvement, spiking neural networks are computationally expensive to simulate, therefore, a solution 
using parallel computation was needed. NeMo, a Spiking Neural Network simulator developed at Imperial College, solves this problem 
by making use of CUDA-interfaced GPUs with high level of parallelism.

The aim of this project is to implement the Message Passing Interface for NeMo, and by doing this, improve inter-neural communication, 
to allow for better performance of parallel computations. This, in turn, will allow for bigger number of neurons within the network 
and greater level of realism brought by the simulation.
