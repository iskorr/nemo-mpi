\chapter{Evaluation}

This chapter will cover the project from the point of the impact made, how well it fits within the current trends

\section{Current Solutions}

Cover the work done by 

\section{Criteria of Comparison}

\subsection{MPI Distribution and Communication Overhead}

Graphs and information about the configuration and spike delivery steps, time to complete them

\subsubsection{Setup time}

Complete view upon configuration ditribution and receival

\subsubsection{Simulation time}

Complete view upon the spike delivery system

\subsection{Possible set of criterias}

Possible set of criterias of comparison of the distributed version as opposed to the main one

\section{Results Collection}

Brief introduction into the results collection

\subsection{Number of neurons}

Graphs and explain how the evaluated trends on the graphs show efficiency of the algorithm against number of neurons

\subsection{Number of synapses}

Same - but now with varying neurons (need mapping implemented)s

\subsection{Running time of the simulation}

Runtime of the simulation in focus, no of steps constant

\subsection{Network throughput during simulation}

Firing and spike delivery through the network - how does it compare.
