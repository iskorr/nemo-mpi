\subsection{Problems}
\begin{itemize}

\item {Latency and Spike delivery}

Due to latency within the network of processors the system was tested on, there were a few precedents of race conditions that caused uncertain behaviour of the simulator - therefore, giving output that differed significantly from the desired one. In order to overcome this drawback, a timer system within the master simulation has been implemented - this ensured control of the system, and allowed for stops with delay, to deal with propagating spikes. That move has significantly increased precision of the simulation, moreover, giving a better overview of the performance.
